Challenges and Decisions:
- Partially because it was my initial thought, I check for unique values using a set. I like that it's faster for checking and that I can
minimize db connections.
- I previously saved the db connection credentials and information in a Properties file. Now I can just reference them in the code without
writing them explicitly in the code that gets shared.
- I store the names in the set in all lowercase so my checking can be case-insensitive
